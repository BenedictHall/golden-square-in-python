# The Golden Square Challenges

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/golden_square/python/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

In this module your objectives are:

* Learn to build software as a pair.
* Learn to break programs up into classes.
* Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
* Learn to debug your programs.
* Learn to explain why pairing, object-oriented design, test-driving and
  debugging are powerful practices for software engineers.

You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges
over two weeks.

## Pairing Challenges

Each afternoon you will be encouraged to work as a pair on a Paired Challenge.

Your coach will talk more about these Paired Challenges during this module's
kick-off, but more details and a list of the challenges are available on the
[Paired Challenges](./paired_challenges/README.md) page.

## Progress and Feedback

During this module, you should be **proactively looking for opportunities** to
demonstrate that you've achieved the objectives (above). This will help to keep
your focus on the purpose of the module - those objectives - rather than on how
far through the materials you get.

For details on what and how to submit, see [our guide on getting Feedback in
Golden Square](./feedback/README.md).

> If you want written feedback from your coach(es) during this module, looking for
> and submitting that evidence is _the_ way of getting that feedback.

## Sequence

Work through each of these phases in sequence.

### Phase Zero: The Golden Square Practices

This is reference material. Review each of these so that you can refer back to
them as you work through the exercises.

1. [A concise explanation of The Golden Square](pills/the_golden_square.md)
2. [Just Enough Git to Get Started](pills/just_enough_git.md)
3. [Just Enough Structure To Pair](pills/just_enough_pairing.md)

<!-- OMITTED -->

### Phase One: Testing Bites

Work through this series of exercises designed to help you learn how to write
tests with pytest.

1. [Testing Functions With
   Equality](testing_bites/01_testing_functions_with_equality_bite.md)
2. [Testing Classes With
   Equality](testing_bites/02_testing_classes_with_equality_bite.md)
3. [Testing For Errors](testing_bites/03_testing_for_errors_bite.md)

### Phase Two: Skill Challenges - functions

Work through this series of exercises designed to help you learn a strong
test-driving, object-oriented design, and debugging practices.

1. [Create Your Project](challenges/01_create_your_project.md)
2. [Test Drive a Single-Function
   Program](challenges/02_test_drive_a_single_function.md)
3. [Design a Single-Function
   Program](challenges/03_design_a_single_function.md)

### Phase Three: Skill Challenges - classes

Work through this series of exercises to build on your practices from before,
but now using classes.

1. [Intermezzo: Debugging 1](challenges/04_intermezzo_debugging_1.md)
2. [Test Drive a Class](challenges/05_test_drive_a_class.md)
3. [Design a Class](challenges/06_design_a_class.md) 

### Phase Four: Skill Challenges - class systems

Work through this series of exercises to build on your practices from before,
but now using multiple classes.

1. [Intermezzo: Debugging 2](challenges/07_intermezzo_debugging_2.md)
2. [Test Drive a Class System](challenges/08_test_drive_a_class_system.md) 
3. [Design a Class System](challenges/09_design_a_class_system.md)

### Phase Five: Mocking Bites

Work through this series of exercises designed to help you learn how to isolate
tests using pytest.

1. [Unit Testing Parent-Child
   Classes](mocking_bites/01_unit_testing_parent_child_classes_bite.md)
2. [Crafting Mocks](mocking_bites/02_crafting_mocks_bite.md)
3. [Unit Testing Peer
   Classes](mocking_bites/03_unit_testing_peer_classes_bite.md)
4. [Unit Testing API
   Requests](mocking_bites/04_unit_testing_api_requests_bite.md)

### Phase Six: Solo Project

Do this project solo. It is designed to help you test all of your skills.

[Takeaway Project](projects/README.md)

### Phase Seven: Challenge Project

Optionally, do this extra tricky challenge project designed for engineers who
reach the end of the sequence and want to really test their skills.

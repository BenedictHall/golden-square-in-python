# Design and test-drive a function

**This is a process feedback challenge.** That means you should record
yourselves doing it and submit that recording to your coach for feedback. [How
do I do this?](../pills/process_feedback_challenges.md)

## Paired Challenge

Follow the [design recipe](../resources/single_function_recipe_template.md) to
implement the following user story in a project:

```
As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string `#TODO`.
```

After you're done, as a pair filling out the form together (i.e. just one
submission per pair), [submit your recording
here.](https://airtable.com/shrvo9ePjlwnaiLv5?prefill_Item=gspy_as01)

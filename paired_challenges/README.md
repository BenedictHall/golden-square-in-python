# Paired Challenges

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/golden_square/python/paired_challenges/example_answers.x/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

One of the learning objectives of this module is to:

* Learn to build software as a pair.

and so these challenges give you an opportunity to practice this new skill.

## Progress & Pairing

You will be given a _tracker_ for this module on which you'll record your
progress. Your coaches will use these trackers to pair people at a similar point
in the module to each other.

Pairs will be announced around lunch time each day in your cohort channel.

Contact your pair on Slack and work with them from 14:00 until 16:00 at the
latest on *one* of the Paired Challenges below - you should pick one challenge
you both haven't yet done, which works with where you have got to in the module.
Don't pick something too far ahead or you may find you'll have taken on a
challenge on something you've not yet learned about!

Don't work on more than one Paired Challenge a day - if you want to keep working
in your pair, either on some exercises in the curriculum or just learning things
together, that's also a great use of the rest of the paired time in an
afternoon.

## Not paired?

If you're not in a pair today, voluntarily or otherwise, don't worry! Just carry
on working through the module solo in the afternoon instead.

## Process Feedback Challenges

Like in your previous modules, some challenges will involve recording yourselves
and you'll submit the work for your coach to review and provide feedback on.
These are marked with a :satellite:.

Part of the assessment will involve how you work together in your pair, so these
are great opportunities to get valuable feedback on how a developer is most
likely to be writing software - with someone else, as a pair.

## List of the Golden Square Paired Challenges

Below is a list of the challenges - note that they are grouped according to your
progress through the module. Pick challenges that match your progress, making
sure to complete the Process Feedback Challenges whenever possible.

_Each of these challenges is marked with :hot_pepper: emojis to denote how
challenging they are. A single chilli :hot_pepper: is the most straightforward,
and five chillies :hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper:
would be very challenging._

* Phase Zero completed
  * 1. [Git workflow - simple](./git_workflow_simple.md) :hot_pepper:
  * 2. [Git workflow - complex](./git_workflow_complex.md)
       :hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper:
* Phase One completed
  * 3. [Testing a simple class](./testing_a_simple_class.md) :hot_pepper:
  * 4. [Testing a complex class](./testing_a_complex_class.md)
       :hot_pepper::hot_pepper:
* Phase Two completed
  * 5. [Design and test-drive a function](./design_and_tdd_function.md)
       :satellite: :hot_pepper::hot_pepper:
  * 6. [Design and test-drive a more complex
       function](./design_and_tdd_complex_function.md)
       :hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper:
* Phase Three completed
  * 7. [Design and test-drive a class](./design_and_tdd_class.md) :satellite:

       :hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper:
* Phase Four completed
  * 9. [Design and test-drive a class system](./design_and_tdd_class_system.md) :hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper:
* Phase Five completed

        requests](./mocking_classes_and_api_requests.md)

### Exceptions

If you're paired up but don't have any challenge you've both yet to complete,
consider picking something only one of you has done, with the person who has
already done it in the _Driver_ role if it's a coding challenge.

If you're paired up but have both finished all the challenges, consider doing a
review of each other's planning and/or code, perhaps from one of the solo
projects at the end of the module. It'll be good practice to try giving feedback
on code that someone else wrote - be considerate though, and think about the
sorts of feedback you'd like to receive or would feel is valuable. Feel free to
reach out to your coach for tips and advice on giving code reviews.

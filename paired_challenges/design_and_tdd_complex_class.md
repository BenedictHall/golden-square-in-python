# Design and test-drive a more complex class

## Paired Challenge

Follow the [design recipe](../resources/single_class_recipe_template.md) to
implement the following user story in a project. This will be in a new class.

```
As a user
So I don't forget the details
I want to keep a record of friends' names and birthdates

As a user
So I can make edits when I've got dates wrong
I want to be able to update a record by passing in a name and new date

As a user
So I can make edits when people change their name
I want to be able to update a record by passing in an old and a new name

As a user
So I can remember to send birthday cards at the right time
I want to be able to list friends whose birthdays are coming up soon and to whom I need to send a card

As a user
So I can buy age-appropriate birthday cards
I want to calculate the upcoming ages for friends with birthdays

As a user
So I can keep track of cards sent and to be sent
I want to be able to mark a birthday card for a year as "done"
```

You may want to make use of the `datetime` and `dateutil` libraries here. It's
good practice - dates and/or times are necessary parts of many applications, as
are the calculations between pairs of them.

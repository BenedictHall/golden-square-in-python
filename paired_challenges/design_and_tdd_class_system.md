# Design and test-drive a class system

## Paired Challenge

Follow the [design recipe](../resources/multi_class_recipe_template.md) to
implement the following user stories in a project. This will be in a new class
system i.e. requiring multiple classes.

```
As a car owner
So that I can keep a record of details about my tyres
I want to keep track of the tyres individually, by their position on my car

As a car owner
So that I have the two important pieces of data for a tyre
I want to be able to record both tyre pressure and tyre tread depth

As a car owner
So that I have a history of tyre readings
I want to be able to keep a record of historical readings, when those were, as well as current readings

As a car owner
So that I can see the details of my car at a glance
I want to list the tyres' positions, latest readings and when those were
```

<details>
  <summary>Really not sure what classes to create, despite using the design recipe to think through it?</summary>

  We'd suggest a Car class that makes use of a Tyre class.

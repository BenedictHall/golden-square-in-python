# Feedback

The onus is on you to look for evidence of the core learning objectives of this
module. You can use this evidence for a number of things:

* Proving to yourself that you're learning what you need to learn
* Getting feedback from your coach(es)

## Video Evidence

Some learning objectives (those relating to a _process_) can only properly be demonstrated by observation or video recording. For these...

- [Follow the steps here](../pills/screen_recording.md)
- Narrate / think out loud (and record sound)
- Make sure your recording is *no more than 10 minutes*

The videos don't need to be "complete" - you don't need to show all of a design
being done to completion or the whole program to be developed correctly! Just
enough to demonstrate that you've learnt it is fine.

The videos also don't need to be "perfect" - they're just examples. If you're
demonstrating the right knowledge/skill, that's all that matters.

## Written Evidence

Other learning objectives can be demonstrated without video, perhaps by some code, a diagram or something else. For these...
- Be sure to include a short reflection on your work
- Leave a question or two for your coach

## But... how do I know when to record a video?

You'll be working on code throughout the module - keep the learning objectives
in mind (it's a good idea to keep referring back to them) and look for
opportunities. For example, if you're about to work as a pair on something, and
maybe you've already done a little practice together, that's probably a good
time to record something demonstrating the first objective!

If you don't yet understand what one of the objectives is about, that's OK,
it'll relate to a part of the curriculum you haven't got to yet. They'll be
obvious when you get there.

## Learning Objectives and Examples

### Build software as a pair

> For this, you'll need to submit a video but if you also demonstrate test driving / debugging in the same video it can be used to demonstrate more than one learning objective.

Any time you're working in a pair with someone on some code, building software,
there's an opportunity to record this and to demonstrate how you're working.

Good things to try to demonstrate on the <10 minute video are:

* That you both have clearly defined roles
* That you're both engaged in the exercise at hand
* That you're listening to each other and communicating well

### Break programs up into classes

> For this, you should submit one of your recipes

If you're working on a design recipe that needs multiple classes, start
with the design recipe markdown file. Remember, it's the
design that's important here, not the implementation.

Good things to try to demonstrate are:

* Using the supplied multi-class design recipe template
* That you have considered the required functionality, as per the user story/stories
* Specifying what the class takes as inputs, outputs, etc.

### Test-drive programs with multiple classes

> For this, you should submit a video

Doing some good test-driven development, showing the process you've learnt in
Golden Square? Sounds like that's time to record a video of it!

Good things to try to demonstrate on the <10 minute video might be:

* A full red-green cycle from adding a new test and watching it fail to completing the implementation, watching the test pass
* Any refactoring afterwards, once the test is green

### Debug your programs

> For this, you should submit a video

If you find yourself with an unexpected error that's not immediately obvious and
you'll need to do some digging, that's the point where you'll be getting your
debugging skills going - it doesn't matter what the issue is (or if you actually fix it), how you
investigate it is worth recording.

Good things to try to demonstrate on the <10 minute video might be:

* Analysing error messages.
* Using `print()`, the interactive debugger, loading the file into the REPL or
  even adding some usage of the function/class to the file and running it
  manually
* Talking about what you're learning and discovering by doing it (even if you
  never get to the final answer, you can still display debugging and gaining
  information from it!)
